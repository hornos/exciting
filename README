Exciting Lite is the light version of the upstream code. Only the bare
minimum is kept. It also features a restructured directory structure as
well as a simple build system and Makefile topology.

All the necessary auxiliary library is in exc.lib/ directory and can be
compiled separately. Most of them are downloaded on the fly. See
exc.lib/Makefile.

There is an object dependency generator (exc/build/objdep.py) which
produces exc/Makefile.objdep from all the directories in exc/ that
starts with src_ recursively. Fortran INCLUDE, USE (module) and
preprocessor #include are supported.

1. Libraries:
  cd exc.lib
  make
  cd..

  Edit target.arch.make files for your needs

3. Build
  ./build -c -d -m

  binaries will be renamed to target


Manual Compilation:
